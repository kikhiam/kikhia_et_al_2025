%% Calculating the ring volumes for each cell 
% 
% Input: The Matlab table "simulations.mat", which is the ouput of
% Monte_Carlo_a
%
% What does the code do? 
% It calculates the volumes of the concentric rings around each cell.
% The process is computationally heavy because for rings that are partially
% residing in the image, the volume outside the image should be excluded. 
% This is achieved using the Antenna Toolbox which allows to work with
% geometric shapes and caclulate thier intersection areas.
%
% Code structure: 
% The code uses parfor for executing for-loop iterations in parallel 
% on workers, which makes the code 4x faster. The table simulation is a 
% braodcast variable in this code and matlab gives a warning for it but
% code still runs and the warning can be ignored. 
%
% Output: N x 1 cell, where N is the number of images. Each row contains a
% matrix n x 30 matrix where n is the number of cells in that image. These
% matrices save the volume of each ring around each cell in the dataset. 
% 
% Prerequsits: Antenna Toolboxâ„¢, Parallel Computing Toolbox
%
% Runtime on demo data = ~ 40 minutes.
